        <p>
            Hi! My name is Carter Saladin and I have been skiing since I could walk, and I am now in my 17th season. I grew up spending every Saturday at my home mountain of Stevens Pass, Wa, and every winter break traveling the west coast on ski trips. I am a type III+ skier meaning that I am at an expert level and comfortable skiing any terrain. My main setup is 179cm Dynastar mFree 99s that have Pivot 15 Gold bindings, and I ski with a boot flex of 110. I am a true all mountain skier, the only thing I avoid are rails in the terrain park. 
        </p>

        <h2>My Rankings</h2>
        <p>
            I am ranking these mountains in a 1-10 system thats takes into account snow conditions, prices, crowds, and mountain operation. This is all from personal experiences and apart from Stevens Pass I have only been to each resort between 1-5 times, meaning if I missed a good day/season, my rank may not be 100% accurate. However, based on my experience as a skier, I can tell if a mountain is at its peak, or if I am just there on a bad day, so that is also taken into account.
